~SELECT datname FROM pg_database; is used to list all databases in a PostgreSQL instance.

~\c <dbname>;  to change the database

~drop database <db name>; to delete database

~\d tableName; to see table

~\dt :to see list of tables

Certainly! Here's a basic PostgreSQL syntax example for a subquery (query inside a query) in code form:
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees
);
