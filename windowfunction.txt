Window functions:
ALSO known as analytic functions allow you to perform
calculaations across a set of row related to the current row

Defined by an OVER() clause.

Benefits of Window Functions

Advanced Analytics: They enable complex calculations like running totals, moving averages, rank calculations, and cumulative distributions.

Non-Aggregating: Unlike aggregate functions, window functions do not collapse rows. This means you can calculate aggregates while retaining individual row details.

Flexibility: They can be used in various clauses of SQL, such as SELECT, ORDER BY, and HAVING, providing a lot of flexibility in writing queries.
